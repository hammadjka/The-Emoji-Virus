Whither shall I wander
Upstairs and downstairs
And in my ladys chamber
There I met an old man
Who wouldnt say his prayers
So I took him by his left leg
And threw him down the stairsMy grandfathers clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped short Never to go again
When the old man died
strongChorusstrong
Ninety years without slumbering
Tick tock tick tock
His life seconds numbering
Tick tock tick
It stopped short never to go again
When the old man died
In watching its pendulum Swing to and fro
Many hours had he spent as a boy
And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know
And to share both his grief and his joy
For it struck twentyfour when he entered at the door
With a blooming and beautiful bride
But it stopped short never to go again
When the old man died
Chorus
My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound
And it kept in its place not a frown upon its face
And its hand never hung by its side
But it stopped short never to go again
When the old man died
Chorus
It rang an alarm In the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming its flight
That his hour of departure had come
Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short never to go again
When the old man died
ChorusWash hands well each day
To keep germs away
Scrub with soap and water
And be on your way
Wash hands well each day
To keep germs away
Scrub with soap and water
And be on your wayHappy birthday to you Head shoulders knees and toes

Heres my scarf and heres my hat
When I see the snowfall
Hear me shout
 All you children please come outI saw a ship asailing
Asailing on the sea
And oh but it was laden
With pretty things for thee
There were comfits in the cabin
And apples in the hold
The sails were made of silk
And the masts were all of gold
The fourandtwenty sailors
That stood between the decks
Were fourandtwenty white mice
With chains about their necks
The captain was a duck
With a packet on his back
And when the ship began to move
The captain said Quack Quack
Ive been working on the railroad
All the live long day
Ive been working on the railroad
Just to pass the time away
Cant you hear the whistle blowing
Rise up early in the morn
Cant you hear the captain shouting

And cant tell where to find them
Leave them alone
And theyll come home
And bringing their tails behind them
Little Bo peep fell fast asleep
And dreamt she heard them bleating
When she awoke she found it a joke
For they were all still a fleeting
Then up she took a little crook
Determined for to find them
She found them indeed but it made her heart bleed
For theyd left their tails behind them
It happened one day as Boo Peep did stray
Into a meadow hard by
There she espied their tails side by side
All hung on a tree to dry
She heaved a sigh and wiped her eye
And over the hillocks went rambling
And tried what she could
As a shepherdess should
To tack again each to its lambkinLittle Boy Blue

Was in his mothers pail
Simple Simon went to look
If plums grew on a thistle
He pricked his fingers very much
Which made poor Simon whistleSing a song of sixpence
 A pocket full of rye
Four and twenty blackbirds
 Baked in a pie
When the pie was opened
The birds began to sing
Wasnt that a dainty dish
To set before the king
The king was in his counting house
Counting out his money
The queen was in the parlour
Eating bread and honey
The maid was in the garden
Hanging out the clothes
When down came a blackbird
And pecked off her noseNoneSleep baby sleep
Our cottage vale is deep
The little lamb is on the green
With woolly fleece so soft and clean
Sleep baby sleep

Down where the woodbines creep
Be always like the lamb so mild
A kind and sweet and gentle child
Sleep baby sleep
See the bunnies sleeping till itâ€™s nearly noon
Shall we wake them with a merry tune
Theyre so still are they ill
Wake up little bunnies
Hop little bunnies hop hop hop
Hop hop hop  Hop hop hop

Wonderful girl and boy land
While you dwell within it
You are ever happy there
Childhoods joy land
Mystic merry toyland
Once you pass its borders
You can never return again
When youve grown up my dears
And are as old as I
Youll laugh and ponder on the years
That roll so swiftly by my dears
That roll so swiftly by
Childhoods joy land
Mystic merry toyland
Once you pass its borders
You can never return againTweedledum and Tweedledee
Agreed to have a battle
For Tweedledum said Tweedledee
Had spoiled his nice new rattle
Just then flew down a monstrous crow
As black as a tarbarrel
Which frightened both the heroes so
They quite forgot their quarrelTwinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
When the blazing sun is gone
When he nothing shines upon
Then you show your little light
Twinkle twinkle all the night
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Then the traveller in the dark
Thanks you for your tiny spark
He could not see which way to go
If you did not twinkle so
Two little dickie birds
Sitting on a wall
One named Peter
One named Paul
Fly away Peter
Fly away Paul
Come back Peter
Come back Paul Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town
Up stairs and down stairs in his nightgown
Tapping at the window crying at the lock
Are the children in their bed for its past ten oclock
Hey Willie Winkie are you coming in
The cat is singing purring sounds to the sleeping hen
The dogs spread out on the floor and doesnt give a cheep
But heres a wakeful little boy who will not fall asleep
Anything but sleep you rogue glowering like the moon
Rattling in an iron jug with an iron spoon
Rumbling tumbling round about crowing like a cock
Shrieking like I dont know what waking sleeping folk
Hey Willie Winkie â€“ the childs in a creel
Wriggling from everyones knee like an eel
Tugging at the cats ear and confusing all her thrums
Hey Willie Winkie See there he comes
Weary is the mother who has a dusty child
A small short little child who cant run on his own
Who always has a battle with sleep before hell close an eye
But a kiss from his rosy lips gives strength anew to me NoneWind the bobbin up
Wind the bobbin up
Pull Pull Clap Clap Clap
Point to the ceiling
Point to the floor
Point to the window
Point to the door
Clap your hands together  1 2 3
Put your hands down on your knees
Yankee Doodle went to town
Aridin on a pony
Stuck a feather in his cap
And called it Macaroni
Yankee Doodle keep it up
Yankee Doodle dandy
Mind the music and the step
And with the girls be handy
